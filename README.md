### What is this?

This is an open index of corporations and their unconditional grants to open source projects. It's inspired by such writings as [Matt Mullenweg's "5 for the future"](https://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/).

- **Tier:** Grant divided by # of employees, abstracted to a tier designation. Further reading below.

### Tiers explained

Tiers are ranked high to low, higher being better. Each tier denotes an actual number produced by dviding a company's grant by its employee count. It's not perfect, but it's a start!

Tier 0 = $50-$499
Tier 1 = $500-$999
Tier 2 = $1000-$1499
Tier 3 = $1500-$1999
Tier 4 = $2000-$2499
Tier 5 = $2500-$2999
Tier 6 = $3000-$3499
